# React Rollup Library
A React TypeScript library using Rollup


## How to test the package Locally
1. Install the dependencies
    ```bash
    pnpm i
     ```
2. Generate the package tarball.
   ```bash
    pnpm pack
    ```
    A tarball `react-rollup-lib-1.0.0.tgz` will be generated on the current directory.
3. On the root directory of the project you would want to use the package.
   ```bash 
    pnpm i /{path-to-tarball}/react-rollup-lib-1.0.0.tgz
    ```
